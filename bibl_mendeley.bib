abstract = {Over the past two decades scientists, mathematicians, and engineers have come to understand that a large variety of systems exhibit complicated evolution with time. This complicated behavior is known as chaos. In the new edition of this classic textbook Edward Ott has added much new material and has significantly increased the number of homework problems. The most important change is the addition of a completely new chapter on control and synchronization of chaos. Other changes include new material on riddled basins of attraction, phase locking of globally coupled oscillators, fractal aspects of fluid advection by Lagrangian chaotic flows, magnetic dynamos, and strange nonchaotic attractors. This new edition will be of interest to advanced undergraduates and graduate students in science, engineering, and mathematics taking courses in chaotic dynamics, as well as to researchers in the subject.},

abstract = {We investigate the dimension of intersections of the Sierpiński gasket with lines. Our first main result describes a countable, dense set of angles that are exceptional for Marstrand's theorem. We then provide a multifractal analysis for the set of points in the projection for which the associated slice has a prescribed dimension.},
